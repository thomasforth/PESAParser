# PESAParser
Scripts to parse and combine multiples PESA (public expenditure statistical analyses) and CRA (country and regional accounts) databases and tables into a single file. This gives a full picture of UK public spending using consistent geographies and definitions from 1999/2000 (YearEnd 2000) to 2017/18 (YearEnd 2018). 2018/19 data will be added shortly.
